//! Adobe YCCK CMYK JPEG (APP14 `color_transform = 2`) decode.
//!
//! Per Adobe convention, YCCK JPEGs store YCbCr derived from the inverted
//! CMY (i.e. `rgb_to_ycbcr(255-C, 255-M, 255-Y)`) plus an inverted K. When
//! `jpeg-decoder` 0.3 reverses the transform via `color_convert_line_ycck`,
//! its output is the **inverted** CMYK form: `255 - actual_value` per
//! channel for the first three components, and straight K. pdf_oxide must
//! apply `255 - x` to the first three channels (the K channel was already
//! inverted by jpeg-decoder) to recover straight CMYK.
//!
//! This differs from the APP14 `transform = 0` (plain CMYK) case, where
//! `jpeg-decoder`'s `color_convert_line_cmyk` already returns straight
//! CMYK — see `tests/test_jpeg_decoder_cmyk_contract.rs`.
