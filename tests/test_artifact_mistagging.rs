//! Regression tests: PDF text extraction must not mis-tag content that
//! only coincidentally resembles a running header/footer/page-number as
//! a pagination artifact.
//!
//! One case: distinct per-page form line-item labels ("1a", "2a", "3a",
//! ...) get treated as a running pagination artifact, because digit
//! values are normalized away when detecting recurring page numbers — so
//! "1a" and "2a" both look like the same recurring varying-digit pattern
//! (e.g. "Page 1"/"Page 2"), even though they are unrelated content on
//! different pages, not chrome. The mis-tag happens purely from reading
//! the document's spans, independent of whether any header/footer/artifact
//! removal is ever requested.
