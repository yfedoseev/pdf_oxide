//! A promoted rowspan label must not overtake the value on the row above it.
//!
//! `reorder_rowspan_labels` re-keys a candidate label to `anchor + 1.0`, where
//! `anchor` is the baseline of the dense row it belongs above. The offset is
//! deliberately smaller than the 3 pt row band, so the promoted span lands in
//! the SAME band as that row and then sorts within it on x — which is the
//! whole point: a label promoted to a row must read at that row's left edge.
//!
//! `row_aware_span_cmp` breaks a within-band x tie on the baseline, larger y
//! first. The promoted key is 1.0 pt LARGER than the row it was promoted onto,
//! so wherever the promoted span shares an x with a real member of that row —
//! a two-line table cell, whose continuation line starts at the same left edge
//! as the line above it — the synthetic +1.0 wins the tie and the continuation
//! is emitted BEFORE the line it continues, with the real row member pushed
//! out behind it.
//!
//! Geometry is the load-bearing part of this fixture, and four properties are
//! each required:
//!   * the value column's continuation rows (y=613.42, y=586.06) sit on
//!     baselines the label column never uses, so they are misread as labels;
//!   * the label column's widest entry reaches within 18 pt of the value
//!     column, so `has_clean_column_gutter` does not call the page
//!     two-column — otherwise `assemble_text_from_spans` never runs the
//!     row-aware sort at all;
//!   * body text above AND below the table, so the label column is the dense
//!     one and the value column counts as sparse (5 * 2 < 12);
//!   * `599.50` and `599.50 + 1.0` round into the same 3 pt band.
//!
//! Poppler, PyMuPDF, pdfium and pdfminer.six all read the value column in
//! drawing order on this page.
