//! Two runs drawn over the same horizontal extent from the same origin are
//! two lines of text, not one kerned word.
//!
//! A chart legend that stacks its labels by drawing them at the same place
//! produces span pairs whose baselines differ by a fraction of a thousandth
//! of a point. The XY-cut leaf sort compares baselines with a row-aware
//! comparator (so that jittered OCR baselines keep their reading order), which
//! collapses that difference into one band and interleaves the two labels by
//! x. The flow assembler then sees the second label restarting within half an
//! em of the first label's ORIGIN while overlapping its ink by four em — and
//! no arm of its negative-gap chain claimed that shape, so the two labels
//! concatenated into `maximumminimum`.
//!
//! ISO 32000-1:2008 §9.4.3: the show operators paint the glyphs they are
//! given, so two runs painted over one another are two runs.
//!
//! Geometry is taken from the page that exposed this: two 9.35 pt labels whose
//! origins sit 0.90 pt apart and whose baselines differ by 8.6e-4 pt.
//! Hand-built synthetic PDF; no third-party fixture.
