//! Every soft-hyphen case in one place, with the authority for each.
//!
//! This behaviour was changed three times in one release and each change
//! patched whichever unit test happened to fail, which is how a rule that
//! deletes a drawn character survived three reviews. The cases are enumerated
//! here instead, so a change to any of them shows up as a labelled failure
//! rather than a test to edit.
//!
//! The two rules the table encodes:
//!
//! 1. **A marker inside one span is always kept.** A span is one run drawn on
//!    one line, so no break occurs at that point and the glyph was painted.
//!    ISO 32000-1:2008 Annex D Note 5 (`docs/spec/pdf.md`:41814): WinAnsi code
//!    255 is a soft hyphen whose meaning is a break, "but it shall be
//!    typographically the same as hyphen". Deleting it deletes a character the
//!    reader sees.
//! 2. **A marker at a seam is judged by geometry.** §14.8.2.2.3 makes U+00AD a
//!    break offered inside a word, and §9.4.2 puts the only evidence of where
//!    the line ended in the glyph positions. That evidence exists at the seam
//!    between two spans and nowhere later.
//!
//! Every "keep" row below is corroborated by poppler, MuPDF, pdfium, pypdf and
//! pdfminer, all of which preserve the marker, and by v0.3.77, which had no
//! soft-hyphen handling at all and therefore kept all of them.
