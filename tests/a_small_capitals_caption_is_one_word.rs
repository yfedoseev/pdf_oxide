//! A caption set in small capitals is one word, not an initial and a remainder.
//!
//! Legal and regulatory tables title themselves with a full-size initial
//! capital followed by small capitals — `COORDINATES` is drawn as `C` at the
//! caption size and `OORDINATES` a couple of points smaller, on one baseline,
//! the second run starting at the first's advance edge.
//!
//! ISO 32000-1:2008 §9.4.4 makes the glyph advance the only thing that moves
//! the text position, so the second run begins exactly where the first ends:
//! there is no gap between them beyond the initial's own advance. A reader that
//! widens its word-space test at a font-size change reads that advance as a
//! space and emits `C OORDINATES`, and the caption stops being searchable under
//! the word it is titled with.
//!
//! Measured on the page this comes from, both halves of the caption abut to the
//! hundredth of a point and carry the same size step:
//!
//! ```text
//! size=8.00  x0=148.66 x1=153.55  "T"
//! size=6.45  x0=153.55 x1=169.91  "ABLE"            <- joins
//! size=8.00  x0=172.57 x1=229.48  "66.01-11(5)-C"
//! size=6.45  x0=229.48 x1=271.80  "OORDINATES"      <- splits
//! ```
//!
//! The pair that splits is the one whose first run is long. That is what the
//! fixture reproduces: a single-glyph run before the size step is not enough to
//! exhibit the defect, so a fixture built that way would pass against it.
//!
//! The counter-case is in the same file, because a rule that simply stopped
//! separating at a size change would glue a heading to the paragraph beneath it
//! and a footnote marker's digits to the following word.
